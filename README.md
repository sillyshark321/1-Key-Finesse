## What is 1KF?
**1KF, or 1-Key-Finesse, is an input method in modern Tetris specialized for 40L Sprint and other speed gamemodes.**

In 1KF, each key corresponds to placing a piece in a specific column and orientation on the board.
Regular 1KF control schemes typically use a 4×10 matrix of keys (1 to /) and spacebar for hold. This is because each piece can have 4 different orientations, and there are 10 columns on a regular Tetris board.
1KF has the potential to be the fastest Tetris playstyle whilst still being accessible for everyone regardless of mechanical skill, at the cost of being difficult to learn.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
**ONLY LEARN 1KF IF...**
- You play modern Tetris duh
- You're willing to spend a lot of time being so atrocious at something that seems so trivial (like typing with an alternate keyboard layout)
- You don’t care about in-game leaderboards
- You think regular guideline controls are restricting
  - You’ve reached your mechanical limit and don’t think you can go any faster
  - You have an injury that prevents you from playing faster
- …and despite all this, you’re willing to give it your all to bump up your PPS or even become the fastest Tetris player (keep in mind that **you’re not guaranteed to become faster** than you used to by using 1KF

This guide is NOT for average players that simply want to “get faster”. This is about a niche, experimental playstyle that doesn’t get much recognition next to the usual guideline stuff.

If you are unfazed by these warnings, then step right ahead! Good luck with your 1KF journey ^^
