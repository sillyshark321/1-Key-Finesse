## Training Tools

### Double-tap mode
The first input of a key will preview the placement, and the second input will place it.
Justin1L8’s 1KF code for Jstris already has it!
Change this line in the Tampermonkey script:
```static doubleTapConfirmation = true;```

## Miscellaneous

### What about TETR.IO?
**❌ Nope! ❌** \
1KFing is a bannable offense, as you need to use macros to play with it. (You can still play if you don't have any intentions of cheating in-game, make your own AHK script or ask me)
